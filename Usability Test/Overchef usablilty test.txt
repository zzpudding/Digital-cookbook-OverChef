Description:
Shanghai-Style Braised Pork Belly (Hong Shao Rou), or “red cooked pork,” is a very famous dish in China. Everyone knows it, and there are many versions and twists based on the original. Some of the more well-known variations include the addition of squid (sounds odd, but boy, is it tasty), hard boiled eggs, and tofu knots.

Ingredient:	3 /4 lb. of lean pork belly (cut into 3/4-inch thick pieces)
		2 tablespoons oil
			1 tablespoon sugar (rock sugar is preferred if you have it)
			½ tablespoon dark soy sauce
			1 tablespoon light soy sauce
			3 tablespoons shaoxing wine
			2 cups water
Serving Number: 2

Step:
”Bring a pot of water to a boil and blanch the pork for a couple minutes.		
”Take the pork out of the pot and set aside."		
"Over low heat, add oil and sugar to your wok."		
"Melt the sugar slightly and add the pork."		
"Raise the heat to medium and cook until the pork is lightly browned."			
"Turn the heat back down to low and add cooking wine, light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, and chicken stock."		
"Cover and simmer for about 60 minutes to 90 minutes until pork is fork tender."	
"Every 5-10 minutes, stir to prevent burning and add water if it gets too dry."		
"Once the pork is fork tender, if there is still a lot of visible liquid, uncover the wok, turn up the heat, and stir continuously the sauce has reduced to a glistening coating."
